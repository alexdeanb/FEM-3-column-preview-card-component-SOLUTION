## My process

This was my first attempt at trying Mobile-first development, and honestly I really enjoyed how it went!
I'm not great at media queries yet, but I feel like what I ended up with works pretty well.

I began with the basic HTML structure and tags. 
Then, I continued with the styling of the basic card layout.
Then I styled the cards as a whole to work together.
Finally, I styled the desktop version.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first time using grid and mobile first. It was only my second time using media queries. All three of these areas were places I knew I needed to better practice, and this allowed me to do so!
